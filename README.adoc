# Stream Applications Acceptance tests

This repository contains extended testing for https://github.com/spring-cloud/stream-applications[stream applications].

## Integration Tests

Standalone integration tests for testing the various applications.

## Acceptance tests on Kubernetes

We test a handful of stream pipelines standalone to ensure that they can be run on Kubernetes.

Following are the test pipelines.

* Ticktock (time | log)
* HTTP | splitter | log
* HTTP | splitter | log (with splitter partitioning the data)
* HTTP | router | log
* HTTP | transformer | log
* JDBC (H2) | log
* JDBC (MYSQL) | log
* TCP | log

### Running the tests on minikube

Make sure that you have minikube running and enough memory allocated.

Set the following environment variable in a shell terminal.

`export CLUSTER_NAME=minikube`

In the same terminal window, go to the root of this repository:

```
cd kubernetes
./runK8SAcceptanceTests.sh
```

This script will run all the available tests.
